# Canaria
An optimized and ergonomic alternative ANSI keyboard layout for English and Spanish speakers in the United States, Northern Mexico, and elsewhere in Latinoamerica wherever Espanlges is used.

## The layout
If you are on an ANSI rowstag (U.S. standard) keyboard, use this version:

Canaria is based on the community-optimized keyboard layout [Canary](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary), with one small change added to improve its usefulness to people in the Americas who speak and write in both English and Spanish.  For a deep-dive on the optimizations this layout has, visit the [Canary](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary) git.  Canary is a `CRST` layout that features a homerow well-suited to bilingual EN/ES users in Latin America. 

## What changed from Canary?
The letter `J`.  While `J` makes the least frequent appearance in English (aside from legal documents), in the Spanish language the consonant has more prominence.  For QWERTY typists this letter gets the best position: the home row right index finger.  In Canaria the `J` is rotated up a level on the keyboard to keep its usefulness to Spanish speakers while still making room for the optimization of English.   Many English alternative keyboard layouts push J to the least ergonomic position possible, destroying its usefuless to bilingual people.

## I use U.S. International to code-swith from English to Spanish, shouldn't that be enough?
Well, you're in QWERTY which is not an ergonomic layout.  And you might also be using the AltGr key (right-hand Alt) which is even more damaging for your hands.

There's also 3 dead keys in U.S. International, but we're guessing beyond English and Spanish you're not spending a great deal of time writing for Portuguese, French, German or Norweigan.  You're writing for an Anglophone or Hispanophone audience somewhere in Latin America, verdad?  Bueno.   Less is more, so the backtick/tilde key found in US-English doubles up as the only dead key in Canaria.  AltGr is still there, if you insist on using it.

## Why should I use this keyboard layout vs. QWERTY, Colemak, Colemak-DH, Dvorak, Workman, etc.?

The are many reasons!  The biggest are the rolls.  In Canaria the frequency that syllables or entire words can be keyed with a roll is quite high.   This results in a "flowy" layout design where common English sounds like `tion` `ought` `wha` `int` are rolls.  The more you use a high-roll layout, the faster your typing will get over the expanse of time.

Consider one of the more common suffixes in Spanish: `mente`.  In QWERTY this suffix causes both a redirect and row-jump from the top and bottom row.  It converts adjectives into adverbs like `ly` does in English:

| EN Adjective | EN Adverb | ES Adjective | ES Adverb |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| happy | happily | feliz | felizmente |
| part | partly | parcial | parcialmente |
| cunning | cunningly | astute | astutemente |

In Canaria _for EN and ES_, this suffix is a roll in both languages!  Other frequent suffixes in Spanish work here too, `ía` `illo` `ón`.  All rolls.   The word `desafortunadamente` is so easy to type in Canaria while it's a terror in QWERTY.   Hard words like `xoloitzquintle` also improve in Canaria _at no cost to English performance_.

### Vowel cluster

Canaria has an optimal vowel cluster for both Spanish and English words.  `I` and `A` need to be next to each other for the common in-roll and out-roll patterns both languages have.   Spanish contains more sequences of `ia` and `ía` while `ai` as in `rain` and `aid` appear in English.
