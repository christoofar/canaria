# Ortho translations for staggered-row keyboards

The following downloadables are for the people who are using Canaria on ortho keyboards but have the need
for a soft OS layout version for use on rowstag keyboards like laptops and foreign computers where
taking your ortho keyboard with you is not practical.

The layout looks like this
```
w l y p b f j o u ;
 c r s t g m n e i a '
   q z v d k x h / , .
```

Obviously there is no Angle Mod benefit here as `V` and `X` are your index consonant choices.  This is mostly here
to handle those non-intensive typing cases when you are not at your ortho keyboard.
